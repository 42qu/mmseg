== DESCRIPTION:

pymmseg-cpp is a Python interface to rmmseg-cpp. rmmseg-cpp is a high
performance Chinese word segmentation utility for Ruby. However, the
core part is written in C++ independent of Ruby. So I decide to write
a Python interface for it in order to use it in my Python project.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Runs fast and the memory consumption is small.
* Support user customized dictionaries.

* Only UTF-8 encoding is supported.

== SYNOPSIS:

=== A simple script

pymmseg-cpp provides a simple script (bin/pymmseg), which can read the
text from standard input and print the segmented result to standard
output. Try pymmseg -h for help on the options.

=== As a Python module

To use pymmseg-cpp in normal Python program, first import the module and
init by loading the dictionaries:

  from pymmseg import mmseg

  mmseg.dict_load_defaults()

Then create a Algorithm object and call next_token until got a
None. Or you can simply iterate through it:

  algor = mmseg.Algorithm(text)
  for tok in algor:
      print '%s [%d..%d]' % (tok.text, tok.start, tok.end)

=== Customize the dictionary

You can load your own character dictionary or word dictionary in the
following way:

  from pymmseg import mmseg

  mmseg.dict_load_words('customize_words.dic')
  mmseg.dict_load_chars('customize_chars.dic')

The format for the dictionary is very simple. On each line, you specify
the frequency followed by an whitespace and then the word/character. Just 
don't forget the final newline at the end of the file.  

== REQUIREMENTS:

* python 2.5
* g++

== INSTALL:

Download the package at
http://code.google.com/p/pymmseg-cpp/downloads/list . If you download
the source tarball, you'll need to compile it by

  make build

if you download the pre-compiled version, this step can be skipped.
Then copy the pymmseg directory to your Python's package path. e.g.
/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/ . Now you can use pymmseg in your
application.
